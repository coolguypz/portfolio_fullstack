		"bio": "Challenges keep coming and learning never stops. Lifting weights gives me more abilities to handle the stress at work and running in the morning gives me a good start. Born in an ocean city in China, moved to the US in 2011 to start my adventure and will complete my master's degree in Information Technology in February 2022. In 2019, I updated my web development skills in the Bootcamp. Love programming and data analysis. During the Bootcamp, I completed a lot of programming practices in JS and learned a lot of data mining algorithms in my master program. Learn Google analyst skills and AWS in my spare time. Outside of work, I am a basketball player and personal trainer. Since coming here, I have made friends from different countries, regions and learned a lot about their culture.",
